## ASSIGNMENT 5

For this assignment we are creating a github pfofile and download the desktop application in our local machine. 
This assignment is basically our introduction to how github works. 
We will upload an already existing Python file from our local machine into a repository.

# DESCRIPTION AND STEPS FOLLOWED

1) We have used Python libraries such as numpy, matplot, pandas and seaborn in this project.
2) We were given a dataset called 'youtube_dataset.csv'.
3) It contained the list of the genres of the youtube channels and the total channels dedicated to a particular genre.
4) We defined a function which would generate the total count of the number of channels once we input the channel type in the argument of the function.
